# FinTech-Project_1

Note:
June 17-18th:
I spent all week researching and trying to figure out exactly what set of data would be worth while. So far, I came up with this.

What have I done:
1) Cleaned the data I obtained from (ref to *data_cleaning_horror_comedy.ipynb*)
https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/

I used
- title.basics.tsv.gz

Currently, I felt their wasn't any need to use the other datasets. This might or might not change in the future.

2) After filtering *title.basics.tsv* (899.9 MB) so it's small enough to be uploaded onto github and saving it as csv files in the "Resources" directory, I decided to perform more data cleaning and manpuilation, but not through the same ipynb file. I created *horror_comedy.ipynb* seperately to use that jupyter notebook solely on working with the dataset I have previously filtered.
