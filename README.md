# FinTech-Project_1
## Data & CSV
* Using Sp500, Nas100, and Dow Jones closing data charts I was able to filter the data using Google Sheets to narrow down each dataset to just the closing prices. I was then able to save the Google Sheets as CSV files and then read each CSV file using the Path function.

## Charts
* The charts are all saved as PNG files. I was able to save the line graph and the box plot chart using the code:
*  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
*  plt.savefig(" ")
*  plt.show()

*  I was also able to save the Hvplot charts using the save button  that is provided on the side panel of the displayed image

##Responsibility
* I was responsible for finding and analyzing  the data for the 3 indices
* Submitting the proposal into the read-me
* Creating the slides with the hypothesis and the final answer
