from tarfile import PAX_NAME_FIELDS


* In this project, we look at the current trends in the U.S. stock market and compare them to the current trends in the entertainment world. We have used information such as the yearly closes from the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the SP500 along with information from IMDB regarding the horror and comedy sectors of entertainment. With this information, we will show whether or not the U.S. stock market bears any correlation with the entertainment world. 


## Questions: 
* What is the current economic trend of the stock market? 
* How do the Sp500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones compare to each other?
* What is the trend in popularity regarding Horror and comedy?
* In the mist of economic chaos, do people tend to turn towards comedy as a form of escapism to relieve themselves from economic hardship?
